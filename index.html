        <h3>Game Exercise</h3>

<h1></h1>

<p>A playing area is 100m x 100m. A game has a referee and 10 players. 
A player moves 1m every second and starts out in a random place on the playing area. 
A referee has to give a yellow card to a player if that player moves within 2m of another player. 
It is the player that moves to within 2m gets the card. 
If a player gets 2 yellow cards, the player is ejected from the game for 10 seconds. 
When a player is off 10 secs the player needs to ask the referee if they are eligible to play again. 
The referee will let the player return to playing the first time this happens, but not subsequent times. 
The last player left playing is the winner.</p>

<p>Write a console application that emulates this activity.  </p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<h1></h1>

<ol>
<li>100m*100m translates to 100*100 matrix. In Java that would mean, an array of multi dimensional array of 100*100.</li>
<li>Each location in the matrix can only be occupied by one player at a time.</li>
<li>A player's movement can be rejected if there is an occupant in the cell. 
On rejection, the player will have to wait for another second before he can make a move again.</li>
<li>Player's movement will be random.</li>
<li>There can be, at most, 4 distinct movements allowed to a player, relative to its position,

<ul>
<li>  LEFT,</li>
<li>  TOP,</li>
<li>  RIGHT,</li>
<li>  BOTTOM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the player is in the corner,

<ul>
<li>LEFT-TOP, he can only move to RIGHT or BOTTOM,</li>
<li>RIGHT-TOP, he can only move to LEFT or BOTTOM,</li>
<li>LEFT-BOTTOM, he can only move to LEFT or TOP,</li>
<li>RIGHT-BOTTOM, he can only move to LEFT or BOTTOM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the player is on the edge of the playarea, but not in the corner,

<ul>
<li>LEFT, he can only move to TOP, RIGHT or BOTTOM,</li>
<li>TOP, he can only move to LEFT, RIGHT or BOTTOM,</li>
<li>RIGHT, he can only move to LEFT, TOP or BOTTOM,</li>
<li>BOTTOM, he can only move to LEFT, TOP, RIGHT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol><h3>Abstractions</h3>

<h1></h1>

<p>Following abstractions are used in the code.</p>

<ol>
<li>Playarea: Acts as a coordinator, coordinating players movements.</li>
<li>Referee: Decides foul play, and also whether to allow a player to return.</li>
<li>Player: Moves around the play area.</li>
<li>Cell: A particular point in 100*100 matrix. Is assigned to player occupying it.</li>
